    <p>Hello! My name is Amanda.</p>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m a software engineer who's open to change and challenge. With each role,
      I work hard to learn and grow as a teammate, engineer, and professional. I do best
      when I'm able to see the impact my work has on a product or community.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to be an expert/leader/force in engineering and fintech.
      I know this can be accomplished in many different ways,
      and I'm still defining this path for myself.
    </p>

      I grew up in New Orleans, L.A., before moving with family to New York City,
      where I graduated from Stuyvesant High School.
      In 2020, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from New York University.

      When I'm not coding, you may find me hanging out with friends, painting, or
      drinking bubble tea :-)
