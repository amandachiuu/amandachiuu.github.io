    <p>Hi there! My name is Amanda</p>
    <p>
      I'm currently an undergraduate studying computer science at New York University.
      I have a passion for design, technology, and social good.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew up in New Orleans, L.A., before moving with family to New York City, where I graduated from Stuyvesant High School.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, you may find me doing <a href="">origami</a>,
      playing golf, or drinking bubble tea with friends. I've recently become
      more interested in <a href="">photography<a>.
    </p>

    <h3>What I'm up to now...</h3>
    <p>
      This summer 2018 I'm doing research on data visualization with
      <a href="http://enrico.bertini.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Enrico Bertini</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will be studying abroad in Shanghai in the fall!
