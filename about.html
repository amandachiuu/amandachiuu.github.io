    <p>Hello! My name is Amanda.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m inspired by innovative design, emerging technology, and social good
      that can make the world a better place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I'm an undergraduate studying computer science at New York University.
      I grew up in New Orleans, L.A., before moving with family to New York City,
      where I graduated from Stuyvesant High School.
    </p>
    <p>When I'm not coding, you may find me drawing, aimlessly roaming NYC with my film camera,
      or drinking bubble tea with friends :-)</p>
