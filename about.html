    <p>Hi there! My name is Amanda Chiu.</p>
    <p>
      I'm currently an undergraduate studying computer science at New York University.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a passion for design, technology, and social good. When I'm not coding,
      you may find me doing <a href="">origami</a>, playing golf, or drinking bubble tea with friends.
      I've recently become more interested in <a href="">photography<a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew up in New Orleans, L.A., before moving with family to New York City, where I graduated from Stuyvesant High School.
    </p>
    <p>
      This summer 2018 I'm doing research on data visualization with
      <a href="http://enrico.bertini.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Enrico Bertini</a>.
      I will be studying abroad in Shanghai in the fall!
