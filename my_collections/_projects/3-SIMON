  This past summer, I worked at a rapid-growth fintech startup called
  <a href="https://www.simon.io" target="_blank">SIMON Markets</a>.
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left:20px;">
  [SIMON is working with financial advisors and number of big-name banks
  to create a platform that facilitates the buying &amp;
  selling of <i>risk-managed solutions</i> (e.g. structured products and annuities).<br>

   As the company starts to scale and work with sensitive data (such as a buyer's personal information),
   it becomes increasingly important to have a system to keep tabs on infrastructure and security changes.
   I worked on an automated alert system to send internal emails when it detects a security-related event change in
   the AWS cloud infrastructure. For example, the tool detects changes in public IPs, IAM policy rules, S3 bucket permissions,
   and user-write operations. The tool was written in AWS Lambda, with scalability and abstraction in mind
   so that my team could set up very specific, customizable event alerts in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
  Additionally, I was tasked to work with representatives of cloud-management platforms such as CloudCheckr and Cloud
  Conformity to evaluate and compare how well their products monitor infrastructure and security. Ultimately, I was asked to
  give a recommendation for which vendor SIMON should go with and start the formal process of integrating into SIMON's infrastructure.
