description:
  <p>
    Developed automated alert system to send internal emails when detecting a security-
    related event change in the AWS cloud infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tool detects changes in AWS resources like public IPs, IAM policy rules, S3 bucket permissions,
    and Security Group ingress from all IPs (0.0.0.0/0). I was able to learn in-depth about AWS core services and
    how to navigate and operate within a commercial AWS account.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, I worked with representatives of cloud-management
    platforms such as CloudCheckr and Cloud Conformity to evaluate and compare how
    well their products monitor infrastructure and security. Ultimately, I was
    asked to give a recommendation for which vendor SIMON should go with and start
    integrating the cloud-management platform into SIMON's infrastructure.
