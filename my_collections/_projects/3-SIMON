    <b>
      Developed automated alert system to send internal emails when detecting a security-related
      event change in AWS cloud infrastructure.
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    The tool detects changes in AWS resources like public IPs, IAM policy rules, S3 bucket permissions,
    and Security Group ingress from all IPs (0.0.0.0/0). I was able to learn in-depth about AWS core services and
    how to navigate and operate within a commercial AWS account.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, I worked with representatives of cloud-management
    platforms such as CloudCheckr and Cloud Conformity to integrate their platforms
    into SIMON's infrastructure. During trial periods, I learned how to use their
    products to evaluate and compare how
    well they monitor infrastructure and security.
