  <q>Visualizing Conversation - Development of Analytical Tool to Mitigate Cyber Fraud</q>
  <p>
  This summer, I wanted to try my hand at research. I worked on a data visualization project with
  <a href="http://enrico.bertini.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Enrico Bertini</a>
  at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering in Brooklyn. I liked it so much I decided to organize an
  independent study project during my time abroad at NYU Shanghai this 2018-2019 year.
  (Loosely, it will be related to computational linguistics/NLP.)

  More about this, and my time in the NYU ViDA lab this summer, to come... :^)
