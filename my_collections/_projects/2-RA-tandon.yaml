  <q>Visualizing Conversation - Development of Analytical Tool to Mitigate Cyber Fraud</q>
  <p>
  As part of the 2018 Undergraduate Summer Research program,
  I worked on a data visualization project with
  <a href="http://enrico.bertini.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Enrico Bertini</a> and PhD candidate Jay Koven
  at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering in Brooklyn.
  </p>
  <p>
  In collaboration with a team of email security specialists, we were given a large (and sensitive) text-based corpus,
  of emails between scammers and their targets. The project objective was to create a visualization that allows cyber-fraud investigators
   to identify patterns in email-scamming activity.
  </p>
  <p>
  With my team's help, I created a responsive web tool that displays the temporal sequence of emails between scammers and their network (of accomplices and targets).
  The tool could not only further understanding about how (successful) email-scammers operate for future prevention,
  but also allow investigators to intercept email scams already in progress.

  Hope to get a more detailed post out about this project soon, but for now,
  check out the poster I presented on my summer project <a href="img/2018_SRP_poster.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>!
