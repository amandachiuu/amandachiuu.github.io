  <q>Visualizing Conversation - Development of Analytical Tool to Mitigate Cyber Fraud</q>
  <p>
    <b>
      Created web visualization tool that displays the temporal patterns of emails between scammers and their network (of accomplices and targets).
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
  The visualization tool helps cyber-fraud investigators identify patterns in email-scamming activity.
  Understanding models of how successful email-scammers operate allows us to build more effective countermeasures for the future,
  and even allows investigators to identify and intercept email scams already in progress.
