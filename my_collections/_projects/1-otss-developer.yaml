    My first software engineering job was working as part of a small specialized software development team in NYU IT called Operations Technoology and Support Services (OTSS).
    A single room full of developers, product owners, and student workers outputted some of the university's most significant software,
    ranging from an iOS app for school-wide facilities operations to a web application for NYU financial bond analysis and management.

    Working on a small development team allowed me to make a difference on a large scale project. The department was working on a modular UI remodel of
    a capital project management site. Over the course of my time on the software development team, I worked on one such module, from start to completion.
    I became comfortable coding in Javascript with React, Redux, and Typescript in an Agile work environment.
