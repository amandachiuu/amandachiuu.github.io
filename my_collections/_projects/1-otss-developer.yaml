    <p>
    Developed UI remodel of a capital project management site, specifically the CRUD interface for updating equipment insurance.
    </p>
    <p>
    It was cool to be able to work on this project starting from my time as a product designer and track it to completion
    as part of the development team. 
    The site is used by 100+ administrators across NYU's city campus and manages an average of $300 million in capital projects annually.

    <p>
    I became comfortable using technologies like React, Redux, and Typescript on a large-scale project,
    as well as being part of an Agile team.
