  Before joining the software development team at NYU IT, I was the first student product designer in our department.
  One of the coolest parts of my job was being able to present to and discuss my designs with developers, product managers, and NYU clients (like KPMG).
  Some of my designs were even used for a presentation at an Apple Education conference.

  I was able to develop technical skills using programs like Illustrator, Photoshop, and Axure XP wireframing tool,
  and also improve communication skills working with people from diverse technical backgrounds.
