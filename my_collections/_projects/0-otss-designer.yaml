  Before joining the software development team at NYU IT, I was the first student UX/UI Designer in our department.
  In 5-ish months, I designed wireframes, sitemaps, and icons for 3 internal-NYU web and mobile applications.
  One of the coolest parts of my job was being able to present to and discuss my designs with developers, product managers, and NYU clients (like KPMG).
  Some of my designs were even used for a presentation at an Apple Education conference.

  I was able to develop technical skills using programs like Illustrator, Photoshop, and Axure XP wireframing tool,
  and also improve communication skills working with people from diverse technical backgrounds.

  A little while ago, I had dinner with my former boss and some new student designers. It was awesome seeing how the department has grown!
